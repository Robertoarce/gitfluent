## Self-Assessment System

The self-assessment ratings help the spaced repetition algorithm determine when to show you each word again:

### Rating Guidelines

**Again (Show again soon)**

- You didn't know the answer
- You had to guess
- You want to see this word again soon

**Hard (Increase difficulty)**

- You knew it but struggled
- It took you a while to remember
- You want more practice with this word

**Good (Normal progress)**

- You knew the answer with normal effort
- It felt like appropriate difficulty
- Standard spaced repetition timing

**Easy (Decrease frequency)**

- You knew it immediately
- The word feels well-memorized
- Show less frequently to focus on harder words

### Impact on Learning

Your ratings affect:

- **When** you'll see the word again
- **How often** it appears in future sessions
- **Your mastery level** for that word
- **Overall learning analytics**
